# Pearson-Correlation
 Simple Correlation Calculator

Save your data to the Data.xlsx file, please ensure there is no index column and all columns are the same lenght,
see the format in the sample Data file for reference.

The output file created will have the variables and the correlation value, the variables will appear twice i.e "column 1 & column 2",
and "column 2 & column 1". I did take out the duplicates, but it was harder to parse the information, especially when filtering on a 
specific variable.
